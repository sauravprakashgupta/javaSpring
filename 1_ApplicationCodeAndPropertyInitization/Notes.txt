We instantiated a triangle instance using the getBean method. and in the triangle class we have a instance variable 'triangletype'. We used the spring configuration, the property tag, in order to pre-set the value of the instance variable we wanted. and spring automatically assign this value when the instance variable is required. What the property tag is doing, it is using the setter method to set the value when required. This is called setter injection. There is another way called construct injection.
