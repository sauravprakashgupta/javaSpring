We are going to use Constructor injection in this example

1. We can have multiple constructor as well. But note that we have to be very careful while overriding constructors and beans' constructor args

A. Suppose we have only one constructor for class Triangle, with 2 instance variables.
	public Triangle(String _triangleType, int _height) {
		this.triangleType = _triangleType;
		this.height = _height;
	}
	We have to pass pass 2 argument values for the constructor
	<bean id = "triangle" class = "com.sauravcodeblog.Triangle">
   	<constructor-arg value="Equilateral"/>
   	<constructor-arg value="20"/>
   </bean>
   
   Note that both values are in " " , even 20. Spring is intelligent enough to understand and treat it as an int(if you skip "" for 20, ou will get errors.)
   So by following the order of beans and constructor arguments are accepted as.
   _triangleType="Equilateral"
   _height="20".
   
   So if we reverse the order of constructor arguments or values in Beans.xml. The argument values will become.
   _triangleType="20"
   _height="Equilateral".
   Though this is not correct, but spring will take this as correct input. 
   
   So a better way to do this is by using 'type'(discuss in example B) or by using index value in Beans.xml's constructor-args
   <constructor-arg index="0" value="Equilateral"/>
   <constructor-arg index="1" value="20"/>
   
   So now the order is as per the constructor's order.


B. Suppose We have 3 constructor

	1. 
	public Triangle(String _triangleType) {
		this.triangleType = _triangleType;
	}
	
	public Triangle(int _height) {
		this.height = _height;
	}
	
	public Triangle(String _triangleType, int _height) {
		this.triangleType = _triangleType;
		this.height = _height;
	}
	
   Now in Beans.xml, If we define a constructor-arg with only one value, it will call the first one with only one constructor - 
   public Triangle(String _triangleType) in this case. 
   But Suppose we want to use public Triangle(int _height) constructor.
   The easiest way to do this is by using type=int in the constructor, example - <constructor-arg type="int" value="20"/>. This Beans.xml can be read as use the contrustor with only one value of type int and pass 20 as the value to it.
   
   2.
   Suppose we want to use the constructor with only one argument of type string. You can use the following in the Beans.xml constructor argument
   <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="Equilateral"/>
   
   3. Suppose we want to use the constructor with 2 or more constructor and the order of argument passed is also important
   <constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" index="0" value="Equilateral"/>
   <constructor-arg index="1" type="int" value="20"/>
   
   this will ensure both order and type
