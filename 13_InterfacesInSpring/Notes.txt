Coding to interfaces

Instead of having an instance of the itself directly what we do is we have an interface and then we use the interface and not the bean inside the class. The advantage is that the Drawing Class(class where bean is initialized and called) does not have to know whether it is calling draw() method if triangle or any other shape. rather it is flexible enough to work with any shape.
