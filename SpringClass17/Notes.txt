JSR-250 Annotation

JSR-250 is actaully a standard Java Specification Request that defines all the standard requests that would apply across different technology and different frameworks.

1. @Resource(name="NAME/ID")
This can do a dependency injection by name . Suppose we want to inject bean with id="pointB" as a depencency to the Point Center for Circle class object. Then we need to pass the name/id of the bean to the @Resource("NAME") annotation.

2. @PostConstruct
public void initializeCircle() {
	System.out.println("Circle init function called");
}

3. @PreDestroy
public void destroyCircle() {
	System.out.println("Circle destroy function called");
}

Note noth initializeCircle() and destroyCircle() are custom java object which gets special feature only due to annotaion.

4. To make @PreDestroy() perform its task we have to let the ApplicationContext being shutdown after completion of main method. For this we have to register a shutdown hook using AbstractApplicationContext

import org.springframework.context.support.AbstractApplicationContext;
AbstractApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
context.registerShutdownHook();
